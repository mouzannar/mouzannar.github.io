  <h2>Court Navigator</h2>

  <p>The justice system can feel distant, complex, and full of jargon. This guide is here to demystify it, not by showing you a chart, but by walking you through what court or tribunal you're likely to deal with and what that means for you.</p>

  <div class="card">
    <h3>How the system works</h3>
    <p>In England and Wales, different courts handle different types of legal problems. You’re not expected to know which one applies, we’ll guide you based on what your issue is about.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tribunals</strong> handle things like benefits, immigration, or special educational needs and are often less formal than courts.</li>
      <li><strong>County Courts</strong> deal with most civil issues, like disputes over money, housing, or personal injury.</li>
      <li><strong>Family Courts</strong> deal with child arrangements, divorce, and protection from abuse.</li>
      <li><strong>Employment Tribunals</strong> handle problems like dismissal or discrimination at work.</li>
      <li><strong>Magistrates’ Courts</strong> handle most criminal cases and some family matters.</li>
      <li><strong>Higher courts</strong> (like the Crown Court, High Court, or Court of Appeal) handle more serious or complex cases or appeals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This tool explains the journey based on your issue step by step, in plain English (and ideally other languages).</p>
  </div>

  <h3>What’s your issue about?</h3>
